# CCMSDK C++ Project
	This Project is C++ based intended to call CCM SDK API. It has functions most of the basic funtions that needs to be carried out on Receiver.

# Getting Started
	The easiest way to get started using this project is to clone the repository to your local machine. 
	git clone https://github.com/citrix/CCMSDK-Sample.git

	The source includes a Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 solution called CCMSDK-Sample.sln in (.\CCMSDK_CppSample). Load this solution into Visual Studio 2008 to build the Project.
.\CCMSDK_CppSample\CCMSDK-Sample\inc has the header files which has the list of Functions that can be called.
.\CCMSDK_CppSample\CCMSDK-Sample\CCM_SDK.cpp is the Main Project File which has Sample invocation of few API's of CCM SDK. This gives fair idea about the usage of API's from Cpp Solution
